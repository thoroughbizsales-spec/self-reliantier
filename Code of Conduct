## 🔬✨ Dual-Layer Respect (Core Principle)

**This project uniquely honors BOTH scientific and spiritual perspectives.**

### Scientific Perspective:
- Based on testable, provable principles
- No belief required
- Peer-reviewable methodology
- **Completely valid approach**

### Spiritual/Energetic Perspective:
- Based on MCEO Keylontic Science
- Consciousness and energy framework
- Interpretive lens for system behavior
- **Equally valid approach**

### Community Standard:
**BOTH are welcome. NEITHER is mandatory. Arguments about which is "true" are off-topic.**

✅ **DO**: "From a scientific view, the eigenvalues show..." and "From an energetic view, the Krystal alignment indicates..."  
❌ **DON'T**: "Your spiritual stuff is nonsense" or "Science is limited, only energy is real"

**Focus on:**
- What works pragmatically
- How to serve communities
- Building together despite different frameworks
- Mutual respect and learning

**Consequence**: Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with people involved for specified period. Includes avoiding community spaces and external channels. Violating these terms may lead to temporary or permanent ban.

**Consequence**: Temporary ban from all community interaction for specified period. No public or private interaction with community members during this time. Violating these terms may lead to permanent ban.

## 💚 Restorative Justice

We believe in rehabilitation and growth. When appropriate:

- Offenders will be given chances to learn and improve
- Sincere apologies and changed behavior are welcomed
- Community members who acknowledge mistakes and improve are valued
- We prefer education over punishment when possible

However:
- Safety of community members is always priority
- Some violations require immediate removal
- Patterns of behavior matter more than single incidents

---

## 🌈 Building an Inclusive Community

### We Encourage:

**Accessibility**:
- Using alt text for images
- Captioning videos
- Clear, simple language in documentation
- Multiple learning formats (text, video, diagrams)

**Diverse Perspectives**:
- Engineers AND non-engineers
- Academics AND practitioners
- Scientists AND spiritual practitioners
- Global perspectives, not just Western
- Youth voices valued equally

**Collaborative Spirit**:
- "Yes, and..." instead of "No, but..."
- Building on ideas rather than dismissing
- Celebrating small wins
- Learning from failures together
