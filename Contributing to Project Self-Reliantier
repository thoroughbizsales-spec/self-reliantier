## ✅ Code Standards

### JavaScript/React
```javascript
// Use clear variable names
const fuelEfficiency = calculateEfficiency(fuelMix);

// Comment complex logic
// RMT eigenvalue calculation using power iteration
const eigenvalue = computeLargestEigenvalue(matrix);

// Keep functions focused and small
function optimizeFuelMixture(conditions) {
  // Single responsibility
}
```

### Documentation
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide examples
- Include both scientific and energetic perspectives where relevant
- Proofread for typos and clarity

### Commits
- One logical change per commit
- Clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issues when applicable

---
