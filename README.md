## What is Project Self-Reliantier?

An **open-source autonomous energy system** combining:
- ⚡ **Random Matrix Theory optimization** for multi-fuel management
- 🔒 **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (Falcon-512) for secure networking
- 🖼️ **Steganographic authentication** for hidden signature verification
- 🔔 **Intelligent push notifications** for community engagement
- ✨ **Dual-layer operation** (Scientific + Energetic/Keylontic perspectives)

**Built for community energy independence, education, and hope.**
