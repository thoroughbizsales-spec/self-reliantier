## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### If You Discover a Security Issue:

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue!

**Instead, please:**

### 1. Private Reporting (Preferred)

**Email**: [security@brownandson.com - To be established]  
**GitHub**: Send a private security advisory (if GitHub Security Advisories enabled)

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information (optional)

### 2. What to Expect

**Within 48 hours**: We'll acknowledge receipt  
**Within 7 days**: Initial assessment and response  
**Within 30 days**: Fix deployed (for critical issues) or timeline provided  

### 3. Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- ✅ Give us reasonable time to fix before public disclosure
- ✅ Don't exploit the vulnerability
- ✅ Don't access or modify others' data
- ✅ Act in good faith

We promise to:
- ✅ Respond promptly and professionally
- ✅ Keep you informed of progress
- ✅ Credit you in release notes (if desired)
- ✅ Not take legal action against good-faith researchers

- Information disclosure
- Logic errors in optimization algorithms
- Insecure dependencies

### OUT OF SCOPE (Won't Fix / Not Security Issues):

- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to them directly)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security of hardware deployments
- Theoretical attacks requiring >$1M resources
- Issues requiring physical access to deployment
- Browser-specific bugs (report to browser vendors)
- Issues in "example" or "test" code clearly marked as non-production

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Deployers (Physical Systems):

**Cryptographic Keys**:
- ❌ NEVER commit private keys to Git
- ✅ Generate Falcon-512 keypairs locally
- ✅ Store keys in secure hardware (if possible)
- ✅ Rotate keys periodically
- ✅ Use strong passphrases

**Network Security**:
- ✅ Use VPN or encrypted channels for inter-unit communication
- ✅ Firewall external access appropriately
- ✅ Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- ✅ Keep software updated

**Physical Security**:
- ✅ Restrict physical access to control systems
- ✅ Use tamper-evident seals
- ✅ Log all maintenance activities
- ✅ Train community members on security awareness

**Data Management**:
- ✅ Regular backups (encrypted)
- ✅ Sanitize logs before sharing
- ✅ Review permissions regularly
- ✅ Document security procedures

### For Developers:

**Code Review**:
- ✅ All PRs reviewed before merging
- ✅ Focus on security implications
- ✅ Check for common vulnerabilities
- ✅ Validate input handling

**Dependencies**:
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Review security advisories
- ✅ Minimize external dependencies
- ✅ Audit new dependencies before adding

**Testing**:
- ✅ Test edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Fuzz test cryptographic implementations
- ✅ Validate signature verification logic
- ✅ Check for timing attacks

## 🔬 Known Limitations

### Current System (Simulation):

**Browser-Based Simulations**:
- ⚠️ Run in browser sandbox (limited by browser security)
- ⚠️ No real cryptographic key storage
- ⚠️ Mock implementations (not production-grade)
- ⚠️ Client-side only (no server validation)

**These are acceptable for demonstrations but NOT for production deployments.**

### Future Physical Deployments:

**Will Address**:
- Hardware security modules (HSM) for key storage
- Secure boot and firmware verification
- Intrusion detection systems
- Professional security audits

---

## 🏆 Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

**[To be populated as researchers report issues]**

### Rewards

While we don't currently offer bug bounties, we provide:
- ✅ Public recognition (if desired)
- ✅ Credit in release notes
- ✅ Eternal gratitude from communities
- ✅ Featured in security advisories

**Future**: As project grows, we may establish formal bug bounty program.

## ⚡ Energetic/Spiritual Security (Unique to This Project)

### Metatronic Pattern Detection:

While we honor the Keylontic Science framework, we recognize:
- "Metatronic detection" is an interpretive layer
- Not a replacement for cryptographic security
- Provides additional perspective for those who resonate
- Should not be sole security mechanism

**Best Practice**: Use BOTH layers:
- Scientific security (PQC, encryption, authentication)
- Energetic awareness (intuition, field monitoring, consciousness)

**Neither replaces the other. Both add value.**
